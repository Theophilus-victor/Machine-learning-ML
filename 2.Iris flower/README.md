## 🌸 Iris Flower Species Classifier

This project is a machine learning-based web app that predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its sepal and petal measurements.

### 🔍 Problem Statement
Classify an Iris flower into one of the three species — *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, or *Virginica* — using four numerical features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

### 💡 What I Used
- **Python (pandas, sklearn)**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **StandardScaler for feature scaling**
- **Streamlit for interactive frontend**
- **Custom CSV dataset (no built-in `load_iris`)**

### 🚀 How to Run
```bash
streamlit run iris_app.py
```

*About IRIS

**Iris-setosa** which is one of about 300 species in the Iris genus, named after the Greek goddess Iris, who was a messenger of the gods and linked to rainbows, reflecting the flower's vibrant colors.

**Iris-versicolor** It produces striking flowers, typically blue to violet with yellow, white, or greenish markings at the base of the sepals (falls). The petals range from pale lavender to deep purple, with a delicate, veined pattern. Each flower is 5–8 cm across, blooming from late spring to early summer (May–July).

**Iris-virginica** It is a common wetland perennial that blooms from late spring to early summer (May–July), producing large flowers (6–10 cm across), typically blue to violet with yellow-white centers and purple veins. The sepals are showy, with matching or slightly paler upright petals.
